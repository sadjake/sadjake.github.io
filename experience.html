        <h3>Full-Time Student/Unemployed</h3>
        Sept. 2022 - Present
        <ul>
            <li>Currently taking CMPT 276, CMPT 272, CMPT 318, LING 111</li>
            <li>Most highly performed courses were MACM 316, CMPT 353, CMPT 354, and STAT 260.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h3>Undergraduate Research Assistant @ SFU People and Data Computing Research Group</h3>
        Aug. 2024 - Present
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzed large-scale datasets containing 4,000+ articles and associated metadata related to AI and labor discourse, using Pandas and NLTK to identify the most frequently appearing news websites and extract common n-grams.</li>
            <li>Implemented a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier utilizing TF-IDF vectorization with scikit-learn to analyze articles and categorize them into specific topics related to AI's impact on society and the economy.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h3>Research Intern (NSERC USRA) @ SFU Parallel & Distributed Computing Lab</h3>
        May 2024 - Aug. 2024
        <ul>
            <li>Developed novel flood fill tool variants in JavaScript with p5.js, creating entirely new algorithms based on existing ones.</li>
            <li>Implemented polygon collision, outline, and vertex detection, Delaunay triangulation, Perlin noise generation, and Weiler-Atherton polygon clipping to support the development and experimentation of the new flood fill tools.</li>
            <li>Achieved a 75% reduction in overlap checks for regular polygons (e.g., squares) and a 35% reduction for irregular polygons by implementing spatial hashmaps to optimize polygon collision detection, significantly lowering computational overhead.</li>
            <li>Ensured project scalability and maintainability by designing modular code structure.</li>
        </ul>
